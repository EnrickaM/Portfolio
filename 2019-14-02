Morning:
this morning i tried to d oa grid for my about me page and if yall see it now it still isnt set up correctly but i am going to get it way before Monday morning.
I put context in my journey and I also tried to make an background for my educaion but i didnt go as plan.

AfterNoon:
I just played around with images. I finished linking all my pages.
I am still not done with my project and skiils page and my education page.
After those two are done and cleaned up all the way i will be finish.
I also downloaded my REsume so whoever wants to pull it up he can.

<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p> I was born and raised in Memphis,Tn. I did all kinds of extra curricular activites growing up but I never did anything with computers.
    I do remember growing up and my grandma use to always want me to hook up the computer or a dvd player. So back then i felt like a little technician. After all those years passed , I had finally graduated from high school in 2015 and I went straight to college.I attended Alcorn State University for about 2 years.
    My major in college was nursing, but around my second semester freshman I wanted to change my major to computer science. Unfortunately I did not change it.
    I tried to stick with it , I even left Mississippi and came back home still thinking that I wanted to do nursing. Well thats when life hit me pretty hard.
    I burned my hand in July of 2018 and I just gave up basically. Months pass by and I found out about the code Crew program
    Once I did my research and i had seen that bootcamps like the one i am enrolled in were pretty much hands on. I gave it a shot and here I am 5 weeks strong.</p>

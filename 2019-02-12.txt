Before noon today. I was brain storming on how I wanted to do my project. I came up with my first page with just my heading and at the very end i want an arrow
to lead to the next page. My next page will be the about me page and i want two arrows at the bottom. so for the two arrows at the bottom will direct to the third page.
One arrow will lead to the skills section and the other arrow will lead to my prjexts. Then i will somehow make just make one arrow to lead to the other pages.










Afternoon. I put text in my html files. I also linked my first 2 pages together and i put an image on my first html file.

<h1>Journey</h1>
<p> For the first week in new career of coding went pretty good for me. Everything was fresh and new to me. We were getting into the language Javascript,which was pretty good
So we get to the second week and I was seeing that things were getting a little bit rocky for me. I didnt give up I was doing a little bit of complaining.
The first time in my life I was actually doing something difficult. My problem was my mind going blank once we were getting our graded classwork. Once we were to go
over the lesson I will get it pretty good but then my mind just does its own thing. Now I get down to the third week we are in a different language which is Python. My personal opinion Python
is a great language to use. Things aren't as complicated as JavaScript. On top of that in this course we add everything on top one another. We get into week four and I get real sick so I missed half the week.</p>

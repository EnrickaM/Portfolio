<h1>Journey</h1>
<p> For the first week in new career of coding went pretty good for me. Everything was fresh and new to me. We were getting into the language Javascript,which was pretty good
 Week 2 was pretty good , especially when we got into a different language. In JavaScript I'm a bit comfortable with almost everything. Switch cases are my favorite its just too simple. I enjoy do the for loops. But the do while and the if statements be a little tricky.
    On Friday i was excited that i got to finish my classwork before lunch. Before then my early morning work had to get finish with my afternoon classwork. My only problem is that when we go over the lesson i get it after it has been taught, but when it comes down to the in class work my mind just go blank.
    I don't know why its something new to me. This happens every time we go over something new. So what i do is go back and through the lesson to see what i need to be doing and then that's when i get to rolling with the class work. Now this course it hard but i am maintaining so far. I do get frustrated when i then ran my code multiple times and it doesn't work but eventually i get it right.
    But for now i am loving the Python language because its easier right now , there isn't a lot of steps you have to do like in JavaScript..Week 3 was pretty rough for me. Really towards the end. I had a little emergency to come up so I had missed one day. Now I know that I can’t afford to miss any days. Even though I always look through the material afterwards and before class. I feel like I should get the material broken down from the instructor.
    Overall I did like the beginning of python. I just have to go out of my way to know exactly what I am doing , because everything is pushed on top of another. I still have to work on my while loops because I’m use to doing it the way Kevin first showed us and I always wanna break after my while loops. I really had a breakdown Thursday I don’t know why I started to think negative but I did. I just feel like I really need to get this down pack,
    because I don’t have a backup plan as of now. But I’m not gone need one because I am going to became a Developer.
